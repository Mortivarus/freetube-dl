## Freetube-dl

Small project to convert playlist db files from Freetube into a text file with youtube links that can be bulk downloaded with youtube-dl. 


## Usage

Insert the file path in src/db_handler.py, in the 'file' variable for now. It will put the result in the 'playlists' folder. It doesn't matter whether you insert a single playlist or the full playlists db file. 


## Requirements:
- json package
